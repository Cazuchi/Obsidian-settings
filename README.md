# Obsidian settings
Just my preferred settings for Obsidian. It'll change a lot as I play around with new setups, but feel free to give it a try :)

OBS:
Install Pandoc from: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/3.9
Pandoc plugin already included in obsidian settings repo
Allows for export to .docx and more
